    <h3>Wonders of the World</h3>
    <p>The Wonders of the World is a team of heroes comprised of the majority of the Earth's superheroes that have banded together to protect the world from the forces of Apokolips while also protecting their world from those who would seek to throw their
      society into chaos. The First Wonders were a group of eight heroes who fought against the Steppenwolf and his Parademons during the Apokolips War. The team was lead by the Ternion, which composed of Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman.</p>

    <p>The group faced many hardships during the war including the death of Catwoman, the betrayal of Mister 08 who killed millions of brainwashed people, the death of every Amazon and kidnapping of Wonder Woman's daughter by Steppenwolf. The remaining Wonders
      launched a last ditch effort to end the war, which ended with the death of Wonder Woman at the hands of Steppenwolf, the death of Superman from being exposed to Opal kryptonite and after being driven insane from the kyrptonite, his physiology became
      compromised and was exposed to of solar energy and the death of Batman who sacrificed his life to send all of the Parademons back through the Boom Tubes, and the disappearance of Robin and Supergirl.<br></p>

    <h3>Superman</h3>
    <p>He was found by the new Wonders who were looking for the mysterious alien to fight a brainwashed Superman and they discovered that he too was a Kryptonian. Suffering a panic attack after being freed, Val revealed that he spent most of his life on
      a capsule, thus he was afraid of open spaces. So Lois told him that it was okay to be afraid and that, being a Kryptonian, he could do something to help everyone.</p>

    <p>Starting to develop his abilities, Lois tried to teach Val how to use his powers by finally going outdoors and try to fly. He was doing his best when they were attacked by a horde of Parademons lead by Superman who was behind Val. Saved by Lois, he
      and Hawkgirl were alone against the Parademons until they were saved by Green Lantern who took them to safety. Worried about Lois, Val told Batman that they must save her, but their plan was interrupted by Apokoliptian forces who forced them to
      evacuate the Batcave and escape to Amazonia. Batman blamed Val for not using his powers and letting Red Arrow die, saying it's all on him. When Jimmy approached him, he told him that it wasn't his fault before asking him what he was hiding beneath
      his hoodie, to which he revealed was the symbol of the House of El.</p>

    <p>He explained to Jimmy the situation when the planet was suddenly being sucked by a giant Boom Tube, so when Fate enlightened him, he decided to rise up and stop Superman who clashed against him until he started to crack and crumble, revealing to be
      a twisted, perverted version of Superman who became dust. The battle won, the Wonders decided to use this victory to reclaim their world from Apokolips.</p>

    <h3>Flash</h3>
    <p>Jay Garrick is a speedster and a member of the Wonders of the World on Earth 2 as The Flash. Jay began as a troubled college graduate whose life seemed to be going nowhere. He had been dating a young woman named Joan until she decided that they were
      spinning their wheels. She left him and he decided to contemplate his future on a small hill on the outskirts of town. It was there that what he thought was a meteor crashed nearby, and he chose to investigate.</p>

    <p>He discovered the dying god Mercury, who had just escaped from his captors who had held him since the invasion from Apokolips was defeated. When Jay asked if it was the forces of Apokolips that imprisoned him he said that it was a force much darker.
      Mercury warned that there needed to be a new age of heroes to fight this force and that he saw greatness in Jay that perhaps Jay couldn't see in himself. Before dying he imbued Jay with his power and told him to trust no one. Soon after, the police
      arrived, and Jay ran at speeds he couldn't expect. While testing out his speed, he was confronted by Hawkgirl who had been expecting him.</p>

    <p>Jay and Hawkgirl soon discovered that the planet was being overtaken by a force called The Grey, and they journeyed to Washington, DC to put a stop to its avatar, Solomon Grundy. They defeated him with the help of the Green Lantern and The Atom.</p>

    <h3>Batman</h3>
    <p>Unlike his Prime Earth counterpart, Thomas Wayne survived the mugging by Joe Chill. Unbeknownst to his son Bruce, Thomas, while still in medical school in 1979, developed connections to the Falcone crime family after he saved Frankie Falcone from
      a gunshot wound. Falcone insisted on showing his gratitude to Thomas by introducing Thomas to the wild lifestyle of partying and drugs the Falcones' wealth enabled.</p>

    <p>Martha insisted that Thomas cut all ties to the Falcone family and in doin so, Frankie hired Joe Chill to kill them, but only succeded in killing Martha. After Thomas went into hiding, years later Thomas returned, and systematically killed Chill,
      the three thugs in Falcone's employ, and finally Frankie Falcone himself. While investigating these crimes, Bruce, now the Batman, discovered that Thomas was alive and after a heated confrontation wherein Bruce learned the whole truth about his
      father's sordid past, and disowned Thomas.</p>

    <p>After the death of his son during Darkseid's invasion, Thomas took up the mantle of Batman to honor his son and attempt to atone for his own failures.</p>

    <p>When Earth was threatened by Steppenwolf and later the clone of Superman, Thomas traveled to the World Army's Arkham Command Center to free certain prisoners from the facility, releasing Aquawoman and James Olsen from their statis cells to join his
      resistance. He also discovered the Joker among the prisoners and promptly killed him.</p>

    <p>Thomas helped the Wonders and the World Army stop Superman, who at first was believed to be a brainwashed agent of Darkseid, and his Hunger Dog allies from using a Boom Tube to transport the Earth into Apokolips space. After Superman was revealed
      to be a clone and was disintegrated by both Val-Zod and Red Tornado, Thomas would be united with his granddaughter Helena, who was now going under the identity of the Huntress during her time on Prime Earth.</p>

    <h3>Green Lantern</h3>
    <p>Alan Scott was a young, openly gay media mogul, who dedicated his work to the heroes who gave their lives three years prior in the war against Darkseid. He was in a relationship with Sam Zhao, and while on a business trip in Sam's native China, he
      worked up the nerve to propose. Unfortunately, just before Sam could accept the proposal, the train crashed suddenly, killing nearly every passenger except Alan - including Sam.</p>

    <p>After the crash, a Green Flame appeared before Alan Scott and told him that he had been chosen to become the protector of the Earth. With a threat on the horizon, it urged Alan to accept the combined power of the Earth's energies, using the engagement
      ring intended for Sam as a conduit for that power. This would allow him to create green energy constructs, limited only by his imagination. Though the Green Flame had saved Alan, it could not do anything to save the others, and so Alan accepted
      the offer for the sake of his lost love and the others who died.</p>

    <p>Almost as soon as Alan became the protector of the Green, an opposing force chose its own Avatar. The Grey chose Grundy as its champion, and the dead man began sending the force of decay throughout the earth. He waited at Washington, D.C. for the
      Green's protector, claiming that they could not co-exist. In order to defeat Grundy, he dragged the man to the moon, where he would be so far removed from the Grey as to be powerless. However, having been disconnected from the Green himself, and
      after exerting the last of his power to throw three nuclear missiles into outer space, Alan crashed down towards the Earth. At the last second, he was saved by Hawkgirl.</p>

    <p>Once back on the ground, the Flash laments the havoc wrought by the powers of Grundy, whom before his defeat had succeeded in eradicating almost all plant life on earth. The Green Lantern, driven by instinct proceeds to focus the earth's energies
      and release them into the ground; causing new sprouts and crops to form at the area the energy touched. When the Flash inquires on what exactly he did, Alan replies that much of what he does is instinctual and that he's only partly aware of what
      he's doing, but that he believes that he has given the earth the boost it needs to rid itself of Grundy's decay.</p>

    <h3>Hawkgirl</h3>
    <p>Kendra Munoz-Saunders is a treasure hunter by profession. Because of her reputation, she was hired by the World Army for a particular project which resulted in the permanent grafting of wings to her back.</p>

    <p>Some time later, she met with the Flash in Europe. She was guided by a certain Fate as to where she might find him. Together, they went to Washington, D.C. and fought Grundy, without much success. They were later joined by Green Lantern, and subsequently
      by the Atom. They were only able to defeat Grundy when Green Lantern carried Grundy out of the Earth's atmosphere, and stranded him on the moon.</p>

    <p>Despite his help against Grundy, the Atom, under orders from the World Army, tried to capture Hawkgirl, but she escaped with the help of the Flash. Green Lantern then returned to Earth after removing the danger of the nuclear missiles that the World
      Army launched under the advice of Terry Sloan. Unfortunately, he had run out of power, having been separated from the Earth for too long and exerting so much energy. He was saved by Hawkgirl, who caught him in mid-free fall.</p>

    <p>Hawkgirl then visited the penthouse apartment of Alan Scott who was still mourning over the death of his partner Sam. Hawkgirl's detective skills allowed her to discover that Alan and Green Lantern were one and the same. She tried to convince him
      to join she and the Flash to form a team against the coming danger.</p>
